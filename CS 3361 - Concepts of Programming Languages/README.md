## Overview
This repository contains three interrelated projects focused on programming language processing and simulation: a Lexical Analyzer, a Parser, and a Cellular Life Simulator. These projects demonstrate fundamental concepts in compiler design, language processing, and parallel computing.

## Lexical Analyzer (Project I)
- Tokenizes input source code into lexemes
- Maps lexemes to appropriate token types
- Handles operators, identifiers, keywords, and literals
- Provides detailed token classification
- Manages whitespace and delimiters
- Reports unknown tokens without crashing

## Parser (Project II)
- Combines lexical analysis with recursive descent parsing
- Implements grammar rules for the Cooke language
- Validates program structure and syntax
- Provides detailed error reporting with line numbers
- Supports control structures (if-else statements)
- Handles mathematical and logical expressions
- Processes input/output operations

## Cellular Life Simulator (Project III)
- Implements a cellular automaton with complex state transition rules
- Utilizes multiprocessing for parallel computation
- Manages shared memory and process synchronization
- Handles file I/O and data validation
- Provides step-by-step simulation output
- Supports configurable process count for performance optimization
