## METRO-W: Wireless Model Railway Control System
METRO-W (Managing Efficient Transportation Rail Operations Wirelessly) is an innovative approach to model railway control that uses wireless communication and microcontroller automation to provide an affordable alternative to traditional DCC systems.

## Key Features
- Wireless Control: Uses TCP/IP communication between a Raspberry Pi 4 central controller and Pi Pico W locomotives
- Real-time Monitoring: Speed monitoring via rotary encoders with real-time velocity feedback
- Automated Safety: RSSI-based distance monitoring with automated emergency stops when trains get too close
- Track Automation: RFID-based track switching with servo-controlled turnouts
- Dual GUI Control: Independent control interfaces for multiple locomotives using OpenCV
- Custom Hardware: 3D-printed track sections compatible with standard track infrastructure
- Battery Operation: No track power required, operates on rechargeable Li-ion batteries
